This directory contains all the required files for building a scanner
for the TINY language. Depending on where the JFlex package is installed, 
you need to specify the path for "jflex" accordingly in Makefile.

To build the scanner, type "make" in the current directory, which will 
generate a bytecode file called Scanner.class.

To test source code like "fac.tiny", type "java Scanner < fac.tiny" 
and the token sequence will be displayed on the screen. 
To save the token sequence to an output file "fac.out", just 
type "java Scanner < fac.tiny > fac.out".

To rebuild the scanner, type "make clean" and type "make" again.
